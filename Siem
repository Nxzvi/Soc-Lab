Threat Detection and Monitoring Using Wazuh SIEM
Author: Nezvi Hussain
Role Focus: SOC Analyst (Entry Level)

1. Introduction
Security Operations Centers (SOC) play a critical role in detecting, analyzing, and responding to cybersecurity threats in real time. Modern organizations rely on SIEM platforms to centralize logs, correlate security events, and provide visibility into endpoint and network activity.
This project focuses on deploying and operating Wazuh SIEM in a controlled lab environment to simulate real-world SOC operations such as log monitoring, alert triage, threat detection, and basic incident response.

2. Objectives
The main objectives of this project were:
• Deploy a functional SIEM environment
• Collect logs from Windows endpoints
• Detect common attack techniques
• Analyze security alerts
• Map threats to MITRE ATT&CK
• Perform basic incident response actions

3. Lab Environment
Component	Description
SIEM Manager	Wazuh Server (Linux VM)
Endpoint	Windows 10 system with Wazuh Agent
Tools	Wazuh Dashboard, Sysmon, Nmap
Platform	Virtualized lab (VMware/VirtualBox)

4. SIEM Deployment
The Wazuh Manager was installed on a Linux virtual machine using the official installation script. The dashboard was accessed via a web interface for monitoring and alert visualization.
A Windows endpoint was configured with the Wazuh agent to forward:
Authentication logs
Process creation events
System activity logs
Network-related events
Successful agent communication was verified through the Wazuh management console.

5. Log Collection & Monitoring
Once agents were connected, the SIEM continuously ingested:
• Windows Event Logs
• Security events from Sysmon
• System behavior logs
These logs were parsed using Wazuh decoders and correlated against detection rules to generate alerts for suspicious behavior.

6. Threat Scenarios Simulated

🔐 Brute Force Authentication Attack
Multiple failed login attempts were generated on the Windows endpoint. Wazuh detected abnormal authentication behavior and triggered alerts indicating potential credential attack activity.
Mapped MITRE Technique:
T1110 – Brute Force

🌐 Network Reconnaissance
Port scanning activity was performed against the endpoint to simulate attacker reconnaissance.
Detected Indicators:
Multiple connection attempts across ports
Abnormal network traffic patterns
Mapped MITRE Technique:
T1046 – Network Service Discovery

⚙️ Suspicious Command Execution
System-level commands such as user enumeration and process listing were executed to mimic attacker discovery behavior.
Mapped MITRE Techniques:
T1087 – Account Discovery
T1057 – Process Discovery

7. Alert Triage & Analysis
Each alert was analyzed based on:
• Source IP
• User account involved
• Timestamp
• Event frequency
• Severity level
False positives were filtered while suspicious events were escalated for further investigation.

8. Incident Response Actions
Basic SOC response actions included:
Identifying affected endpoint
Reviewing related logs
Correlating events across time
Documenting findings
Recommending password resets or system review

9. Skills & Technologies Applied
✔ SIEM deployment & configuration
✔ Endpoint security monitoring
✔ Log analysis & correlation
✔ MITRE ATT&CK framework
✔ Threat detection techniques
✔ SOC investigation workflow

10. Conclusion
This SOC lab project successfully demonstrated the deployment and operation of a SIEM platform for real-time threat monitoring and detection. By simulating common attack techniques such as brute-force login attempts, reconnaissance scans, and suspicious command execution, the project provided hands-on experience in security event analysis and incident response.
The experience strengthened practical SOC analyst skills including alert triage, log investigation, and threat mapping, aligning closely with real-world SOC Tier 1 operations.
